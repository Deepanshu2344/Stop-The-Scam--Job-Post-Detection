# 🚨 Spot The Scam: Job Post Fraud Detection

A Machine Learning and Streamlit-based app to detect fraudulent job postings using job description text and structured features.

---

## 📖 Project Overview

Fake job listings are a growing problem on online job boards. Our project uses natural language processing and a classification model to detect potentially fraudulent job posts.  

The model analyzes job descriptions and metadata to classify posts as **Fraudulent** or **Legitimate**. An interactive Streamlit dashboard visualizes the predictions and insights.

## ⚙️ Key Features & Technologies Used

- **Python 3**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy** for data manipulation
- **Scikit-learn** for:
  - TF-IDF vectorization  
  - Random Forest Classifier (our final model)  
  - Evaluation metrics (F1-score, confusion matrix, ROC-AUC)
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn** for visualizations
- **Streamlit** for creating an interactive dashboard
- **Joblib** for saving the trained model

## 📥 Setup Instructions (Step-by-Step)

1. **Clone this repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Deepanshu2344/Spot-The-Scam--Job-Post-Detection.git
   cd Spot-The-Scam
2. Install the dependencies
    ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Run the Streamlit app
   ```bash
   streamlit run streamlit_app.py

## 📊 Model Behavior & Output
->  The model takes TF-IDF features from job descriptions along with structured metadata.
-> It outputs the probability that a job post is fraudulent.
-> If this probability is high (e.g. above 0.5), the job is flagged as fake.

## 📈 Model Evaluation
Model Used: Random Forest Classifier

Why?
-> Excellent with imbalanced data
-> Provides feature importance
-> Robust and interpretable

🔍 Metrics:
-> F1-Score: Your model’s F1-score here
